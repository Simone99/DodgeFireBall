# DodgeFireBall

**DodgeFireBall** is a fast-paced arcade game where you must survive an endless rain of fireballs!  
Dodge as many fireballs as you can ‚Äî but be warned, the longer you survive, the harder it gets.  
The screen will fill up with fireballs bouncing around, moving faster and faster as time goes on!

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- Move freely inside a static 2D screen.
- Fireballs spawn randomly within the screen and bounce off the edges.
- Every 10 seconds, a new fireball spawns.
- Every multiple of 10 fireballs, their speed increases.
- A single hit ends the game ‚Äî how long can you survive?

**Controls:**
- **Keyboard:**  
  - Move: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys or Arrow keys  
  - Pause/Start: `Enter`
- **Controller:**  
  - Move: Left Stick or D-Pad  
  - Pause/Start: `Start`
